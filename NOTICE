This file constitutes "Additional Terms" as permitted under Section 7
of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

These terms supplement — not replace — the AGPL-3.0 license.

==========================================================================

1. GENERATED OUTPUT CLAUSE

   Software, code, configurations, or other artifacts produced by this
   program ("Generated Output") that are used in a commercial context —
   including but not limited to: sale, licensing, provision as a service,
   or integration into commercial products — are subject to the following:

   a) Attribution Required. Any commercial use of Generated Output must
      include prominent attribution to this project:

      "Built with God-Agent (https://github.com/BobbyRuby/rubix-protocol)"

   b) Runtime Integration. If the Generated Output depends on, queries,
      or otherwise integrates with this program's runtime systems at any
      point during its operation — including but not limited to: memory
      storage, MCP tool invocation, learning/feedback systems, scheduling,
      or communication systems — the Generated Output and any application
      incorporating it constitute a "covered work" under the AGPL-3.0 and
      must comply with all its terms, including source disclosure.

   c) Standalone Exception. Generated Output that operates entirely
      independently of this program after generation, with no runtime
      dependency or integration, is exempt from AGPL-3.0 copyleft
      requirements but remains subject to the attribution requirement
      in clause (a) above.

2. MEMORY AND DATA INTEGRATION CLAUSE

   Any application or system that integrates with this program's data
   stores (including but not limited to: memory databases, vector indexes,
   embedding stores, communication databases, learning trajectories, or
   session data) at runtime constitutes a combined work and is subject to
   the full terms of the AGPL-3.0.

3. COMMERCIAL LICENSING

   The copyright holder offers commercial licenses that exempt licensees
   from the terms of the AGPL-3.0 and these Additional Terms. Commercial
   licenses permit proprietary use, modification, and distribution without
   source disclosure obligations.

   For commercial licensing inquiries, contact the copyright holder.

4. SEVERABILITY

   If any provision of these Additional Terms is held to be unenforceable,
   the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

==========================================================================

These Additional Terms are effective as of February 15, 2026.
